\u2013 rising above adversities to defeat the odds |\nDo you know how a team of just 6 girls fought hard their way to the title of Runner-up in a highly injury-prone sport? Do you know when was the last time KGP Women\u2019s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it\u2019s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most. \nIn a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters.\n\nIn the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits. \nIt wasn\u2019t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls! \nWhat lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots. As one of the players admitted, even during the practice sessions, participation from juniors was very less. They had a hard time choosing 9 players for the tournament. Participation from girls was utterly disappointing. And if that\u2019s what will keep on going, we don\u2019t stand a chance in rewriting histories in the upcoming Sports Meets. The current players have appealed to the girls to participate in as large numbers as possible. The sports scenario in KGP among girls isn\u2019t in very good shape right now. We needed inspirations to look up to. Now that we have some of them, why to wait? Hit the ground on the very first day of the next semester!"}, {"created_time": "2017-12-25T15:03:47+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1690953644258317", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1690953644258317/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur is with Priyanka Bhaskar and 6 others.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25626256_1690953644258317_4059116407686528605_o.jpg?oh=85525d3e195f143b3d4a06ad453f008b&oe=5ACDE9D3", "message": "| A tale of perseverance and resilience \u2013 rising above adversities to defeat the odds |\nDo you know how a team of just 6 girls fought hard their way to the title of Runner-up in a highly injury-prone sport?

Do you know when was the last time KGP Women\u2019s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it\u2019s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most. \nIn a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7. One player was in beginning stages and lacked in the experience that it takes to play at bigger stages. Effective count goes to 6. How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters.\n\nIn the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong. All the practice, hard work and perseverance bore sweet fruits. \nIt wasn\u2019t their victory alone. It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him. The captain Remee marshalled her troop well and her leadership was the key to this entire campaign. A huge shout to these amazing girls! \nWhat lies in the future? Most of the current players are graduating out. The team needs enthusiastic and dedicated junior players to fill the boots.

This silver, for sure, is no less than gold, for them, for us, for all Kgpians.\nMen's Volleyball team took on hosts IIT Madras in quarter finals and were straightway put under pressure by the opponents. They did reply back with winning the next game but couldn't hold thereafter, suffering a 1-3 loss and missing a chance to go to semi finals. For most of the games in this tournament, they had their tails up and that something they would be extremely proud of.\nMen's Basketball team was up next, taking on heavyweights IIT BHU in quarter finals.

KGP sealed it's spot in Semi-Finals by getting past IIT BHU with a score of 57-55. \nMen's Tennis team was last in the fray for today, playing the 3rd place decider match with IIT Delhi. They put each ounce of their energy in the court but we got to admit that opponents player better. With a loss by 0-2 to IIT Delhi, IIT KGP got fourth place in Men's Tennis.\nHence, KGP stands with a total of 6 gold medals, 5 silver medals and 7 bronze medals after six days of the ongoing sports meet.

With IIT Kharagpur needing either a win or just a draw against IIT Roorkee to bag the top spot, our players managed to hold the strong opponent team to a draw and thus, winning the trophy. \nWhile Hemanth (White) won his match, Vivek (Black) and Kaustav (Black) drew their matches. However, Prithwi (White) went down to the strongest player of the tournament. With 1 win, 2 draws and 1 loss, the match was drawn with a score of 2.0-2.0. The draw meant IIT Roorkee settled for the silver medal and hosts IIT Madras got the bronze medal. \nThroughout the tournament, IIT Kharagpur had maintained its dominance over opponents. Their journey to the title included wins over IIT BHU (4-0), IIT Kanpur (3.5-0.5), IIT Bombay (2.5-1.5), IIT (ISM) Dhanbad (3.5-0.5), IIT Guwahati (3.0-1.0), draw with IIT Roorkee (2.0-2.0) and a solitary loss to IIT Madras (1.5-2.5).\nAn impressive record of 5 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss is certainly the fruits of the mental toughness and chess acumen of all the players. But what stands out for KGP in this journey is the outstanding performance of Kaustav Chakraborty, a first-year student, who wasn't only adjudged the second best player of the tournament but also was instrumental in KGP winning the crown with 5 wins and 2 draws in his 7 games. Though he lost to Tamhankar Viraj (IIT Roorkee) by just a mere difference of 0.5 points for the title of 'Best player of the tournament', showcasing such strong chess skills at such a big stage and making opponent players bite the dust effortlessly is no mean feat! And the contingent captain Hemanth Kumar Potluri infused the much-needed confidence into the team and marshalled the troop to the glory. Prithwi, Vivek, Saurabh and Gajendra too got into the act and had fun giving opponent players a taste of their own medicine. \nTheir individual performances were as follow:\nKoustav Chakraborty - 6 points (7 games) - 5 Wins, 2 Draws\nVivek Gupta - 5 points (7 games) - 4W, 2D, 1L\nHemanth Kumar Potluri - 4 points (7 games) - 3W, 2D, 2L\nPrithwi Sinha - 2.5 points (4 games) - 2W, 1D, 1L\nSaurabh Desai - 2.5 points (3 games) - 2W, 1D\n\nThis win marks a milestone as far as Chess Culture at IIT Is concerned.

I have personally thanked our Director, IIT Kharagpur for being the part of the Open House session till the end and helping us resolve all the facts.\n\nWe had several meetings with different stakeholders to have an immediate action plan for our problems and prepared a thorough list of solutions. The attached action plan contains the suggestions of ours and the Director. I have tried to give few insights in each of the step giving you more clarity on the same.\n\nACTION ITEMS\n\nThe following points are references to the pdf attached. Kindly go through following points after going through pdf.\n\n1) As asked by few students in the Open House session, the Director has agreed for the external inquiry to be set up. He has himself talked to a retired judge of High Court for the same. However, on expressing concern from our side regarding the problems students involved in the event may face, the Director assured by saying that it will be tried to reduce the friction as much as possible.\n2) For the medical audit of BCRTH an expert committee will be appointed in 15 days, panel which would consist of about 2 male and 1 female doctor. We are expecting the audit to be done by the end of December.\n3) A complain portal with a complain escalation mechanism is being prepared. The basic feature of the complain portal will be prepared by us which would then be reviewed and improvised by the B C Roy Technology authorities. We are expecting the portal to be implemented by next week.\n4) Digitalization of B C Roy Hospital: We have proposed to make all the process of a normal visit of a student to BCRTH digitalized. This will include taking an appointment online, making a student's profile containing all the details of previous visits. Digitalization will remove all the ledger related work and will involve the least paper work. We are also trying to incorporate this in ERP helping students in a systematic approach towards the health issues. It will take about 3 months for the finalization.\n5) BCRTH has been stocked with certain life-saving items like anti-venom, anti-rabies etc and other items like clothes to be reviewed in one week. It has been done to equip the hospital 24*7 prepared to tackle few emergency issues.\n6) Regarding the public statement from the Institute, the Director has shared the Open House video from his personal Facebook page.\n7) We are taking a lot of initiatives by conducting several events for mental well being and also training G Sec Student Welfare Council, TSG and Student Welfare Group. For the same, an annual calendar list will be prepared and will be followed every year.\n8) A Dean's Council is being formed to assist Dean, SA and to tackle more student affairs.\n9) For a better fire emergency solutions, a plan is being developed by the security to have fire drill and checking the quality of extinguishers.\n10) One Annual Health Checkup (not mandatory) whose expenses will be integrated with medical insurances.\n11) Tie-ups with Railway hospitals are being made to handle more cases locally.\n12) A framework will be planned by December to develop a regulatory mechanism to assess the performance of BCRTH and Counselling Centre throughout the year.\n13) One Extra Academic Activity to be incorporated in already existing EAA system, National Cultural Organization. Technology Students' Gymkhana in association with SANDHI and Happiness Centre will be working on the same.\n\nStatus of ongoing action items have also been listed in the pdf. I urge you all to stay concerned about the progress of these points as they are of dire need, I will be more than happy to update you about any further development (ping me anytime). As I have stated in my earlier mail also that we, as a student community is also at fault somewhere as you can observe lack of interaction between seniors and even batch-mates, we need to revive our culture which is the core of our development and for the same I will communicate feasible action plan soon.

We have been working hard to compile all questions collected by Awaaz\u2019s and the VP\u2019s survey. We want to finalize a repository of questions that cover different aspects of the issues at hand.

Conversation with Mr Raghuvanshi, ASP\nThe purpose of visiting him and sharing the conversation was to bring out a missing perspective regarding the situation. We identified his to be a unique standpoint having closely seen both incidents people have been talking about. However, we were unable to frame our interaction to portray the same intention. By no means was that document a hidden threat against protests, a way to shift blame or even an attempt to absolve the status of B.C. Roy\u2019s facilities. We apologize for any anger or dissatisfaction caused due to our inability to recreate the conversation for you. No one can stop you to express yourself through peaceful protests.

A repeat of what happened back in 2009 can have some regretful consequences for some people, and we do not want that to happen to anyone unnecessarily. \n\n5. Limiting the session to only B.C.R.H and Counseling Centre\nTo fulfil the objective of getting concrete solutions and directed answers, it is extremely necessary to keep asking questions that are on point. Diversifying the topic might lead to the focus being shifted, or people getting lost in the conversation. We will have other similar sessions in the future to tackle other issues. We hope you will show similar fervour towards them as well. \n\n6. Action plan \nThe student community is filled with anger and sorrow. It is important to channel these emotions productively. We plan to use this session to put up our demands. The administration is given an ultimatum to come up with the solutions, and the plan for implementation.

We also lay out our plan of action (point 6) to get our demands heard and met.\n\n1. Incident report\nIt was compiled to make student community aware of the account given by the eyewitnesses, and the responses (or the lack of it) by the administration on the same. We kept everything in the raw format so that the students could judge for themselves which claims are true, or what answers are satisfactory. We encourage everyone to raise any point from that report in the Open House in case they are unsatisfied. \n\n2. Questionnaire distribution to admin and students\nThe objective of the Open House is to get clear cut answers out in the open to pressing questions and queries in the students\u2019 minds. This was the reason behind floating the questionnaire to the student community in advance. However, to prevent anyone from getting away from answering a difficult question by a simple \u2018we will look into it and get back to you\u2019, we think it is important that they receive a copy of the questions beforehand and come prepared to face the students. We will release the same copy to the students as well.\n\n3. Selection/Filtering of questions by Senate for Open House This was the most disheartening impression held by the students communicated to us. As the Senate, we are always on the students\u2019 side. We have been working hard to compile all questions collected by Awaaz\u2019s and the VP\u2019s survey. We want to finalize a repository of questions that cover different aspects of the issues at hand. We hope you can trust us enough to not tamper with the questions and let difficult ones be skipped by anyone. The major part of the session is for students to ask questions directly, a report of which will be compiled and again sent to everyone.\n\n4. Conversation with Mr Raghuvanshi, ASP\nThe purpose of visiting him and sharing the conversation was to bring out a missing perspective regarding the situation. We identified his to be a unique standpoint having closely seen both incidents people have been talking about. However, we were unable to frame our interaction to portray the same intention. By no means was that document a hidden threat against protests, a way to shift blame or even an attempt to absolve the status of B.C. Roy\u2019s facilities. We apologize for any anger or dissatisfaction caused due to our inability to recreate the conversation for you. No one can stop you to express yourself through peaceful protests. At the point when things start to escalate and lose control, the police will be bound to take actions. His statement was supposed to be a warning to students to keep things in check for their own benefit. A repeat of what happened back in 2009 can have some regretful consequences for some people, and we do not want that to happen to anyone unnecessarily. \n\n5. Limiting the session to only B.C.R.H and Counseling Centre\nTo fulfil the objective of getting concrete solutions and directed answers, it is extremely necessary to keep asking questions that are on point. Diversifying the topic might lead to the focus being shifted, or people getting lost in the conversation. We will have other similar sessions in the future to tackle other issues. We hope you will show similar fervour towards them as well. \n\n6. Action plan \nThe student community is filled with anger and sorrow. It is important to channel these emotions productively.

The removal was postponed by almost a week saying my wound hasn't healed which resulted in my wound getting septic due to inadequate cleaning. The stitch removal process in the septic state was extremely painful and when requested for a surface anaesthetic, I was told that it was a long procedure for allowance. So, I should \"MAN UP\".\n\nExperience 2:\nI was suffering from viral fever and the medicines prescribed by the initial examination couldn't cure me. As it worsened, I was hospitalised after 10 days. In the hospital, I was given high dosages of antibiotic (1000 mg) along with saline drip regularly. This was the first time I was given a drip (completely unnecessary).\nAfter 2 days, my condition worsened with my temperature reaching up to 103 F. I contacted my family doctor who clearly told me that it was impossible to cure me with the medicines I was being given. My parents arrived the very next morning and I forcefully got myself discharged and taken to my hometown.

He wanted to confirm. So, he recommended 'another' X-ray and told me to come after a week because he won't be available. Finally, I settled with having a treatment outside our campus!\n\nA one-liner response that conveyed various things at one go was \"Never been to BC Roy because of bad reviews\".\n\n*All the concerned respondents have already been asked for their consent to publish their experiences here.", "id": "146188872068143_1631096250244057"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-25T13:21:44+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1631060223580993", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1631061580247524/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 7 new photos \u2014 with Nikesh Wasnik and 19 others.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22770747_1631061580247524_3314428544177393915_o.jpg?oh=b00185c00054a9bff6afe8fb813740e0&oe=5A6C861A", "message": "Continuing the thread of presenting the best of the Rangolis that KGP saw this Diwali, here's the Bronze winning Rangoli of RK Hall with the detailed description.\nTheme: Life of Buddha\nDetailed Description: The world today is moving towards a dark age, an age where wars would be inevitable.

Menstruation marks the birth of fertility and this rangoli tries to show this phase of a woman\u2019s life. The upper region of rangoli depicts the universe and the celestial bodies. The moon cycle mirrors a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, which lasts roughly 29.5 days, just as the waxing and waning of the moon. A woman\u2019s menstrual cycle changes from the menstruation of new growth to the ovulation of full power and blossom, to the pre-menstrual phase of harvest and degeneration, and back to menstruation of renewal again. Here you can see Venus, the Greek goddess of love, beauty, femininity, fertility and prosperity. The entire energy of the universe concentrates, forming a spiral, bestowing all its power to give women their inner strength.\nThe menstrual blood is sacred and self-nourishing, as you can see in the centre. These flames represent her core strength to fight her inner demons and also Indian celebrations or yagyas performed when a girl first menstruates. The lotus symbolizes the womb and water her ability to be calm and composed during tense situations. The greenery depicts her connection with Mother nature, the butterflies her freedom and flowers her beauty and elegance.\nTo the right is painted a picture of the harsh realities of today, because early religions never considered menstruation are unholy or impure. Whether ovulating or bleeding, struggling with pre-menstrual syndrome or conception, our bodies, energy levels, sense of self, even our abilities are constantly shifting each and every day. And yet, nobody talks about it \u2013 a taboo among more mundane and everyday topics. The myths, such as, a menstruating woman is dirty and impure, that she cannot worship, that when she touches a tree, it wilts and that can she cannot lead a normal life during that phase are baseless, for it\u2019s not the inner you but only the biology that is changing. Let us accept that menstrual blood is pure, sacred and respect women for being blessed with the power to give birth.\nAs Manu from Hindu Mythology says in Manusmriti, \u201cYatra Naryastu Pujyante, Ramanti Tatra Devtaha, Yatraitaastu Na Pujyante, Savastatra Afalaha Kriyaha\u201d\nWhich means \u2018the divine are extremely happy where women are respected, but where they are not, all actions, however good and holy, are fruitless\u2019. Let's talk about menstruation freely, not as if it's a taboo and let the flower of fertility blossom."}, {"created_time": "2017-10-23T15:10:30+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1629066287113720", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1629064807113868/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos \u2014 with Lavisha Parab and 11 others.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22713552_1629064807113868_4459757730606779719_o.jpg?oh=b9ecc73a07c8c33bb0d79aa9c60044f6&oe=5A746BE6", "message": "Continuing the thread of presenting the best of the Rangolis that KGP saw this Diwali, here's the Gold winning Rangoli of SN/IG Hall with the detailed description.\nTheme: Menstruation\nDescription: Vedic Hinduism and Pagan religion believed that the alignment of the moon and celestial bodies that is, the nakshatras, gave the female her core strength and her ability to reproduce and regenerate.

Whether ovulating or bleeding, struggling with pre-menstrual syndrome or conception, our bodies, energy levels, sense of self, even our abilities are constantly shifting each and every day. And yet, nobody talks about it \u2013 a taboo among more mundane and everyday topics. The myths, such as, a menstruating woman is dirty and impure, that she cannot worship, that when she touches a tree, it wilts and that can she cannot lead a normal life during that phase are baseless, for it\u2019s not the inner you but only the biology that is changing.

The questions were already being raised about the steps taken by the administration to curb the suicides after the campus saw 4 suicides on a trot in the campus last semester but today's incident unearths and points out towards some serious and major loopholes in the existing setup. \n\nFor the reasons understandable, we will not be mentioning any names here.\n\nAs per the information that we have got, the attempt of committing suicide took place around 10:50 am today in LBS hall when the student jumped from the 4th floor of the hall building. He was not a resident of LBS hall of residence. As soon as people found out, they called the ambulance. So, he was soon taken to the hospital in the ambulance. On seeing the student\u2019s condition, BC Roy Technology Hospital referred him to Kolkata.  The ambulance left the campus around 12:10 pm in the noon after completing all the paperwork where the student accompanying him was asked to get the signatures of the warden and a lot of other paperwork which almost took 40 minutes. In the meantime, there was a problem with the lights of the ambulance. So, another ambulance was called. Also, there was another delay of almost 10-15 minutes as the attendant was out of reach. During this time, as the pulse was near zero, the hospital people gave some injections and initial treatment to stabilize his pulse to 40-50. If they wouldn't have done it then he might have passed away right then. So it took nearly 25-30 minutes to stabilize the pulse. And finally, the ambulance left the campus around 12:10 pm.  The ambulance was accompanied by 2 escorts to Kolkata. Two of his friends with the Hall Manager, two attendants, and the doctor were in the ambulance. The driver misjudged a path to the hospital which further worsened the situation. As told by the accompanying students, the behavior of the hospital staff raised a lot of questions as they were not very supportive. The oxygen masks and the drips got mishandled and they were not able to fix it properly again. Prior to some 15-20 minutes before reaching the hospital, ambulance broke down and they were left in a miserable condition.  The students tried to get another vehicle. After a while and a lot of efforts of the students and the policeman accompanying them, a Tata Ace owner agreed to take them to the hospital. As soon as the additional SP and the Director got this news, they informed the hospital at the other end and an ambulance was started in a reverse way to attend the case, but as the ambulance came to the spot, they saw nobody and they got information that they have left using some other source. Midway, the tank of this vehicle got emptied. So, they got it refilled. After all this delay, they reached the hospital couple of minutes after 2:30 pm. And the doctors there, after some time, declared him dead. \n\nThe reasons for the attempt of suicide, the role of administration, faculties, management, counseling center will be raised later after getting all the details. But, the main question that arises here is the ability of the BC Roy Hospital in one of the premier institutes of the country to handle 12,000 students and thousands of people residing in Kharagpur, when it does not even have basic amenities at its disposal and the behavior of the staff coming into question. Can't we have a fully functional hospital as it would serve more than 25000 people! \n\nWe are not blaming anyone for the incident but some major steps need to be taken on priority in order to improve the medical facility standards at BC Roy Hospital as this is not the first time that such events have happened. There have been some major events in the past as well. Referring to Kolkata if any major injury takes place is not a solution.\n\nAnd if this continues without any improvement, the chances of such mishaps happening again are pretty high.

Therefore, results for the Illumination category haven't been declared.\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratultes each and every member of the KGP community who, despite the adversities, made this celebration a grand success!", "id": "146188872068143_1625483590805323"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-19T10:18:26+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499265_1625133154173700_5520948010347294762_o.jpg?oh=fee8787d9082121d47bc58373e113a08&oe=5A39CA92", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1625133154173700/?type=3", "message": "\u0926\u0940\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0924\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0941\u0936\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u0930 \u091c\u0917\u0939 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091c\u094d\u0935\u0932\u093f\u0924 \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u095b, \u0906\u0908\u0906\u0908\u091f\u0940 \u0916\u095c\u0917\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u0915\u0940 \u0913\u0930 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u0940\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0902\u0964", "id": "146188872068143_1625133287507020"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T15:54:04+0000", "pic": null, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/videos/1624414987578850/", "message": "\"It takes years of hard work to build a tradition like Illumination, but it takes nothing to let it decay into the oblivion\", that's what Prof. Somesh Kumar (Dean of Student Affairs, IIT Kharagpur) said when asked about Illumination.

For KGP, Illu is Diwali and Diwali is Illu. For the freshers who will be going to witness this trademark celebration of Diwali for the first time, they must be feeling intrigued when they find the air buzzing with \u2018illu\u2019. They must be having such questions in their mind like what is it? What\u2019s so special about it? What for our seniors are working so hard? is that effort worth it? And all. As the campus media body of IIT KGP, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur feels that the tale of this unique tradition must be passed on to the newcomers.

Each model had about 36-46 cubes of 10 cm sides which were joined to form the Illumination.\nThe project was supervised by Teaching Assistants Mr. Deepanjan Saha and Ms. Vidhu Vinod Bhushan.\n\nWe appreciate this unique and monumental effort of the students and believe that it will take the 'Illumination' culture to new heights!"}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory."}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory."}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory."}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory."}, {"created_time": "2017-10-18T10:55:37+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1624190824267933", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.991636374190051.1073741851.146188872068143/1624190777601271/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 2 new photos.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22490209_1624190777601271_769790864185685294_n.jpg?oh=121ea469760005cbc825c2c4c3036fa4&oe=5A7A5960", "message": "The official schedule and route for the Illumination and Rangoli has been released. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur wishes the KGPians all the best as they put in their best efforts to make this Illumination a life-time memory."}, {"created_time": "2017-10-17T18:16:34+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1623515071002175", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1623596327660716/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 7 new photos.", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22499175_1623596327660716_6209690141452452934_o.jpg?oh=b354f59c23588ab6d714eb1dca16e4f5&oe=5A865E70", "message": "Haven't you got into the groove of 'Diwali' celebrations yet?

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

But a journey worth documenting!\nFrom earning accolades like \u201cThe Nerve of KGP\u201d, \u201cThe Voice of KGP\u201d, and many more to always striving to deliver on the expectations in the best way possible, Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur has come a long way, thanks to the unsung efforts of the league of Awaaz ex-chief editors and ex-editors and the current team members as well. This video recognises their efforts, albeit not all, as all those efforts along with the emotions and the craving for the betterment of KGP community is not too easy to depict. Watch out for how Awaaz has made impact in the campus; be it keeping KGP well-informed, or covering issues which need immediate attention from the administration as well (Security issue, Fee hike issue, Issue of cumbersome CV module last year), or running campaigns (Save Electricity Campaign, Clean KGP Campaign), or active reporting on passport bribery issue in the passport office resulting in immediate halt to such malpractices, and many more. \nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur has always been and will always remain committed to its objective of the betterment of KGP community and sticking to the core values of Constructive journalism.

The next round is scheduled for September 24th.\n\n1) Prepare with a codelab (duration ~2-3 hours)\nWe've prepared a small codelab (a tutorial combining explanation, working example code, and code exercise) to cover some basic algorithms which will help in the upcoming Code Jam Kickstart (CJK) rounds. Even if you do not plan to participate in the upcoming rounds, the codelab should help brush up basics for other algorithmic contests and interviews. \n\nFor the codelab, you would need an internet connection and basic programming skills in a language of your choice, and of course, a little enthusiasm and energy to get through the codelab. We recommend having facilitators (a faculty or a fellow student) who can help if needed, and pursue the codelab as a group exercise. If you're a facilitator, it would be nice to brush up some combinatorics, dynamic programming (DP) and geometry skills. The time it would take a student to finish the codelab would depend on their current understanding and skill, but to err on the safe side, be ready to put in 2-3 hours.\n\n2) Sign-up for the Codelab by 20th Sep\nPlease sign-up via this form ( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuYa3JLlJPSd7xkyVpflIwiqwjsg9TPo9WSCenthdDEG6nQ/viewform ) and we will send you the codelab material via email.

The stadium experienced decent turnout of the crowd cheering for their Halls of Residence. Yesterday, it all started with Junior Men & Women events in 800 meters. SN Hall of Residence performed exceptionally well by bagging a total of 3 medals in Junior Women category. MS Hall, the defending champions of GC Athletics Men, left everyone speechless by securing a total of 5 medals, all the three in the senior category and gold & silver in the junior category. Manish Singh Rana (MMM Hall) managed to win the gold for his hall of residence in both 800 m and 1500 m. Lokesh Reddi and Gaurav Shenoy were among the few names who secured medals in every event they participated and left no stone unturned to contribute towards the sport. Among girls, Bharti Kushal Sharma, Dimple Kapadia, and Hima Swetha showed outstanding performances. In Men JR category, Sagar Kongari, Eslavatha Jaga Deesh, and Sumit Gaurav have shown exceptional performances by winning more than one medal for their respective halls.\n\nMS Hall continues its legacy in GC Athletics by scoring a sum of 53 points on Day 1 and Day 2. According to the current tally of points, the competition for the third position is too fierce with the difference of just one point between RP (14 Points) and LBS (13 Points). In GC Athletics women\u2019s category, SN Hall of Residence is leading others with 30 points. Junior events, however, with the contribution of no points in General Championship, were also quite successful with the active participation in Men\u2019s category.\n\nWith the showcase of such fine performances, we expect the events will exhibit the same enthusiasm and sportsmanship and Day 3 will witness wonders.

Under the Institute of Eminence scheme, 10 select government institutes will be given approximately Rs 1,000 crores. \"The finance ministry has suggested that the IITs should compete for that scheme instead of expecting funds through the Vishwajeet project,\u201d an official said.\nSource: http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earn-it-don-t-expect-it-govt-junks-funding-project-to-iits-instead-says-compete-for-grant/story-NZCMnzbs3y2niSfLe17abK.html", "id": "146188872068143_1587076234646059"}, {"created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000", "pic": null, "link": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882"}, {"created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000", "pic": null, "link": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882"}, {"created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000", "pic": null, "link": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) - 25 points\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) - 24.5 points\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) - 22.5 points\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882"}, {"created_time": "2017-09-06T18:39:06+0000", "pic": null, "link": null, "message": "Open IIT 2017-18 || Hindi Elocution \nResults are as follows:\n\nGold: Vivek Malik (RK) | 25/25\nSilver: Mohd Issa Cholday (Patel) and Yash Shukla (Nehru) | 24.5/25\nBronze: Aditya Ranjan (Azad) and Abha Kumari (SN) | 22.5/25\n\nAwaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates all the winners.", "id": "146188872068143_1586634671356882"}, {"created_time": "2017-09-06T08:04:47+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/21319130_1586280324725650_4532057538525125414_o.jpg?oh=01a788df31d3c9deb0c2771c24d9e899&oe=5A4D6226", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1586280324725650/?type=3", "message": "The Times Higher Education (THE) rankings 2018 of the world\u2019s top 1,000 universities in 77 countries was published yesterday and didn't pan out well for Indian institutions.

In the 67th edition of State Sports Meet which was held on 29th June to 1st July, a team of 6 students represented IIT Kharagpur and performed remarkably well.\nAbin Devassia finished fourth in Discus Throw with a heave of astounding 37.25 metres. He also had 11.68 metres to his name in Shot put. Dimple Kapadia clocked 14 seconds in 100 metres and jumped 4.16 metres in Long Jump. Utsav Mazumder clocked a brilliant 11.9 seconds in 100 metres. Sairam Alla, a seasoned campaigner, took a mere 23.6 seconds in 200 metres. The credit for this marvellous performance and beginning of a new chapter in KGP's sports history goes to the coach Mr. Pranab Sarkar as well.\nAbin Devassia who hails from Wayanad (Kerala), a 3rd year student of Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture, is associated with Discuss Throw as he prefers field events. With only a mere practice of 2 months, he has a record of throwing 37.22 metres which in itself is a great accomplishment.\nKorabu Dimple Kapadia, a student of Agriculture and Food Engineering, is a 100 metres sprinter.

This, if implemented, is surely expected to cause a huge turnaround in the field of engineering education.\n\nSource: https://www.thequint.com/education/2017/07/26/three-internships-mandatory-for-engineering-students-says-javadekar", "id": "146188872068143_1548916871795329"}, {"created_time": "2017-07-26T14:08:46+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20280558_1548768801810136_7141820035001077593_o.jpg?oh=caefa5ce071a318ef098550254f9d6d1&oe=59FDC2EE", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.362016570485371.85116.146188872068143/1548768801810136/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "id": "146188872068143_1548768801810136"}, {"created_time": "2017-07-26T14:08:46+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20280558_1548768801810136_7141820035001077593_o.jpg?oh=caefa5ce071a318ef098550254f9d6d1&oe=59FDC2EE", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.362016570485371.85116.146188872068143/1548768801810136/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "id": "146188872068143_1548768801810136"}, {"created_time": "2017-07-26T05:48:21+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20424105_1548464998507183_8901661319876135054_o.jpg?oh=1528747afa40471cd5cbf24e374ce2fc&oe=5A38E461", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.362016570485371.85116.146188872068143/1548464998507183/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "id": "146188872068143_1548464998507183"}, {"created_time": "2017-07-26T04:00:00+0000", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20374328_1548085178545165_669720266155291134_n.jpg?oh=9cf6e46395e072325ed093ccb2244104&oe=5A3879B5", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1548085178545165/?type=3", "message": "Have a bright idea?
