The degree will be awarded by IIT Kharagpur. <br>  <br> Source: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-kharagpur-tata-medical-center-kolkata-to-launch-joint-programs/articleshow/62256250.cms?from=mdr", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-27T06:34:32+0000", "id": "110716132353072_1569465019811502", "real_time": "12:04PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/events/1978095115776493/", "story": "The KGPian Game Theory Society shared The Indian Game Theory Society's event.", "real_date": "27-12-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p180x540/26063622_592038721127245_4953021242835419678_o.jpg?oh=a550ed3f9a70fc0546131c91f7fe8938&oe=5ACBDED6", "message": null, "source": "The KGPian Game Theory Society"}, {"created_time": "2017-12-27T04:00:22+0000", "id": "1455755204715573_1841873772770379", "real_time": "09:30AM", "link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-kharagpur-tata-medical-center-kolkata-to-launch-joint-programs/articleshow/62256250.cms", "real_date": "27-12-2017", "pic": null, "message": " <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-kharagpur-tata-medical-center-kolkata-to-launch-joint-programs/articleshow/62256250.cms\" target=\"_blank\"> https://timesofindia.indi... </a> ", "source": "Director IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-26T14:53:53+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1693714837315531", "real_time": "08:23PM", "link": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iit-kharagpur-to-test-and-certify-food-items-at-its-campus/articleshow/62244418.cms", "real_date": "26-12-2017", "pic": null, "message": "In a first among the IITs, IIT Kharagpur will soon start certifying food items at its campus for their nutritional value and also check for adulteration. <br> The Analytical Food Testing (AFT) Laboratory at IIT Kharagpur received the National Accreditation Board for Calibration and Testing Laboratories' (NABL) accreditation this month.The lab has the most sophisticated high-end equipment to check for adulteration and quality, and is at par with any international laboratory, according to Professor Rintu Banerjee, Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering and the in-charge of AFT Laboratory.  <br> This is for the first time that any lab in any of the IITs or NITs has been given this accreditation, which has certified food testing in the laboratory. <br>  <br> Source:  <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/education/iit-kharagpur-to-test-and-certify-food-items-at-its-campus/articleshow/62244418.cms\" target=\"_blank\"> https://economictimes.ind... </a> ", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-26T14:32:30+0000", "id": "121094537930788_1933332970040260", "real_time": "08:02PM", "link": "https://medium.com/@studentsalumnicell.iitkgp/chronicles-of-kgp-fragrance-of-fraternity-6ad64ace8c29", "real_date": "26-12-2017", "pic": null, "message": "E9, Chronicles of KGP: \"Fragrance of Fraternity\" <br>  <br> Pink Floyd\u2019s track Time was switched on. \u201c Hey you guys dance like a couple\u201d ordered Jacob!......", "source": "Alumni Cell", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-26T13:29:16+0000", "id": "164477722555_10155966246942556", "real_time": "06:59PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/springfest.iitkgp/photos/a.10150269330762556.351049.164477722555/10155966217622556/?type=3", "real_date": "26-12-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25734289_10155966217622556_1848496002955605387_o.jpg?oh=87ef3d0b69e3ca7e8919d016015e055c&oe=5AF65030", "message": "Clear your calendars and book your tickets as Spring Fest is set to return with it's 59th edition, bringing back the fun and memories with it. <br> Register now at  <a href=\"https://springfest.in\" target=\"_blank\"> https://springfest.in </a> / as we take you to a tribal adventure from 26th - 28nd January, 2018!

Do you know when was the last time KGP Women\u2019s Basketball team had reached into the finals of Inter IIT Sports Meet? No, you might not be knowing! Let us tell you. It was 2004 and it\u2019s after a gap of 13 years that these girls have repeated the same in style by winning the silver medal with an undefeated run till finals! But this journey has neither been a cakewalk nor they were served it easily on a platter. They upped their ante throughout the tournament and took it to another level when it mattered most.  <br> In a fiercely contested contact sport which has high risks of players getting injured, the standard team size used to be 11 and the captain had requested for at least 10. But it was reduced to 9 since the administration felt that there is no need of those 2 extra players in a sport which didn\u2019t have prospects of winning a medal. The Woes didn\u2019t stop there. Out of 9 girls selected for the tournament, one of the most key players had to leave due to a medical emergency at her home. They lost their hopes for the tournament with their star player not being able to make it to the matches. Count goes to 8. One more player sustained an injury and couldn\u2019t play. Count goes to 7.

How do you play a sports tournament which requires 5 players and is highly injury prone? Justina Mathew, Ravali Madambakam, Silla Spandana, Saloni Kirdak, Swati Rawat and Remee Patel did the unthinkable! These six players played the entire tournament (5 matches) without having much luxury of getting substitutes. Out of these players, another key player had an injury in her thumb, which was later found to be a fragment fracture. But she didn't give up, she still took the risk and played all the matches. How about that for an example of perseverance? \u201cA basketball team is like the five fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist.\u201d And they proved so. They not only played, they also topped their pool and steamrolled opponent to reach all the way to finals with 4 wins out of 5 matches in their campaign. And along with winning hearts, they did manage to break the stereotype of basketball being the sport of only tall people. They did it all with good dribblers and long distance shooters. <br>  <br> In the first match itself, they were pitted against the hosts IIT Madras. Loud cheering, home supporters, taller players and what not! And guess what? They announced their arrival in style by beating the favourite hosts by 18-16. The team that no one was giving a chance to put up a fight has suddenly started looking threatening. As if that was not enough, their second successive win over IIT (ISM) Dhanbad by 15-8 sent a strong caution to the winds that they were here to stay, compete and win; not just to make up for the numbers. They gathered the momentum and their victory chariot didn\u2019t stop there. In Quarter Finals, they comprehensively dribbled past IIT BHU by 23-19, sending shivers down the spine of opponents. It was an all-important Semi-Final clash with IIT Bombay. Stakes were high and odds were unfavourable but they rose to the occasion and delivered a nasty blow to Bombay\u2019s hopes of going into Finals. It was tie neck to neck until the last moment when KGP got two free shots in the last 10 seconds of the match. The captain committed no mistake in firing them and the second one went in giving KGP a lead of one point. Can you believe that? A team which was being seen as the one participating just for formality and were no believers in them getting into knockout stages was into the finals! In the finals, they screamed, they ran ferociously, they dribbled hard, they threw all they had, they put each iota of energy their muscles could but credit to the opponents, they were simply better that day. As our players admitted, IIT Roorkee deserved the gold medal. Though they lost by 25-44, their entire campaign was studded with brilliant moments \u2013 the moments they can take pride on! It was nothing less than a roller coaster ride for them where they defied their own expectations and proved the pundits wrong.

It was also a big win for their coach Mr Soumen Mondal who played a pivotal role in motivating the team and strategizing for each match. He believed in them and always reminded them of their potential of getting a podium finish. As the players said, \u201cWithout his strategies, the victory wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d The never-say-die attitude of the team was all he wanted and girls didn\u2019t disappoint him.

The current players have appealed to the girls to participate in as large numbers as possible. The sports scenario in KGP among girls isn\u2019t in very good shape right now. We needed inspirations to look up to. Now that we have some of them, why to wait?

They didn't leave anything they could have done and ultimately, bagged the silver medal. <br> Men\u2019s Badminton Finals: <br> IIT KGP lost to IIT Madras by 1-3. Despite losing the finals, their dream run has been something that will inspire the next generation of badminton players in KGP. Let's take a moment to applaud their efforts. They ultimately bagged the silver medal.   <br> Tennis Women's Third Place Decider: <br> IIT Kharagpur suffered another loss to IIT Delhi by 0-2  (0-2, 0-2) in the hard fought third place decider match and hence, couldn't get the Bronze medal in their pockets. But not to forget, they put out some memorable showdowns on show in this tournament. <br> Basketball Men's Semi-final: <br> IIT Kharagpur beats IIT Kanpur in the thrilling semi-final by 62-44 (11-15, 18-11, 19-5, 14-13). With this, IIT Kharagpur advanced to the final and they will be competing for top honours with the winning team of the other semi-final match (IIT Bombay vs IIT Madras) tomorrow. So, gear up to cheer the team tomorrow. <br>  <br> KGP stands with a total of 6 gold medals, 8 silver medals and 7 bronze medals after seven days of the ongoing sports meet.  <br> Here's the full summary of all the action that unfolded today.", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-22T15:28:33+0000", "id": "198785160233295_1388549224590210", "real_time": "08:58PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/robotixiitkgp/photos/a.198792120232599.37976.198785160233295/1388549224590210/?type=3", "story": "Technology Robotix Society updated their cover photo.", "real_date": "22-12-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/25627174_1388549224590210_3725187709005399070_o.png?oh=daa837299720ad85c9baefd3fb97287e&oe=5AB613D7", "message": "Attention All! <br> There is no need for abstract submissions for the events Stax, Fortress, and Poles Apart conducted by Technology Robotix Society.", "source": "Technology Robotix Society", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-22T14:39:41+0000", "id": "986878814670848_2240917095933674", "real_time": "08:09PM", "link": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdQPSudFjtL5Kd-fBRGXzs45UDWktO8uzddmNKPcb1dOgWmPA/viewform", "real_date": "22-12-2017", "pic": null, "message": "Registrations for Interrobang 2018 are now open! <br> Please register through this form if you will be needing accommodation at Interrobang 2018.

Its final will be played tomorrow.  <br> How could Men's Badminton team stay behind? They too joined the party, completing a treble of teams qualifying for finals. Bruising aside the string challenge of IIT Delhi by 3-2, they too qualified for the finals to be played tomorrow. <br> But everything didn't go KGP's way today. Women's Badminton team suffered a heartbreaking loss to IIT Delhi by 2-1 in quarter finals and hence, losing out to get a spot in semi finals, ending their campaign. <br> Women's Tennis team encountered something similar and we're outplayed by the team that played better today. A 0-2 defeat handed to them by IIT Bombay meant their elegant journey got over which was studded with some sparkling performances in between. <br> Women's Basketball team certainly raised the bar and got something to cheer about. Whatever may the score line suggests, they didn't leave anything to turn up the game in their favour. With a score of 25-44, they lost out on the gold medal to IIT Roorkee. This silver, for sure, is no less than gold, for them, for us, for all Kgpians. <br> Men's Volleyball team took on hosts IIT Madras in quarter finals and were straightway put under pressure by the opponents. They did reply back with winning the next game but couldn't hold thereafter, suffering a 1-3 loss and missing a chance to go to semi finals. For most of the games in this tournament, they had their tails up and that something they would be extremely proud of. <br> Men's Basketball team was up next, taking on heavyweights IIT BHU in quarter finals. The match swinged like anything, but ended up being on our side. KGP sealed it's spot in Semi-Finals by getting past IIT BHU with a score of 57-55.  <br> Men's Tennis team was last in the fray for today, playing the 3rd place decider match with IIT Delhi. They put each ounce of their energy in the court but we got to admit that opponents player better. With a loss by 0-2 to IIT Delhi, IIT KGP got fourth place in Men's Tennis. <br> Hence, KGP stands with a total of 6 gold medals, 5 silver medals and 7 bronze medals after six days of the ongoing sports meet.

Their work has been published in 'Nano Energy journal'.  <br>  <br> The crux of this innovation lies in their approach to finding new types of energy harvesting materials, which is one of the fields of research Prof. Khatua pursues. Their discovery of the piezoelectric property of naturally occurring and abundantly available onion peels has pushed us one step closer to realizing the dream of renewable energy. Their work documents the ability of these materials to power up small devices such as calculators, watches and mobile LCD screens by generating the required energy from different pressure pulses ranging from our minute heart beat pulses to high frequency sounds.  <br> The generated power from these devices could also light up 30 simultaneously connected LED's in series with each other, with a maximum capability of powering 73 LED's. They have also explored the mechanisms and working principles of these devices. The experiments were carried out practically by attaching the devices to the human chest, table fans and speakers to measure the output voltage. <br>  <br> The numerous potential applications of these devices from healthcare monitoring to robotics have been highlighted much in the academia and paved the way for critical acclamation. <br> The Scholars' Avenue congratulates the team on this success and wishes the team much more in the future.  <br>  <br> For more information, you can read the following articles. <br>  <a href=\"https://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=48645.php\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.nanowerk.com/... </a>  <br>  <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/iit-kgp-turns-onion-skin-into-electricity/articleshow/62102402.cms\" target=\"_blank\"> https://timesofindia.indi... </a>  <br>  <br> For reading the published paper, click the following link. <br>  <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285517306468\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sciencedirect.... </a> ", "source": "The Scholar's Avenue", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-17T08:43:39+0000", "id": "129788793265_10156972825893266", "real_time": "02:13PM", "link": "http://4-2.co/2ALgkjC", "real_date": "17-12-2017", "pic": null, "message": "Another year comes to an end.

With IIT Kharagpur needing either a win or just a draw against IIT Roorkee to bag the top spot, our players managed to hold the strong opponent team to a draw and thus, winning the trophy.  <br> While Hemanth (White) won his match, Vivek (Black) and Kaustav (Black) drew their matches. However, Prithwi (White) went down to the strongest player of the tournament. With 1 win, 2 draws and 1 loss, the match was drawn with a score of 2.0-2.0. The draw meant IIT Roorkee settled for the silver medal and hosts IIT Madras got the bronze medal.  <br> Throughout the tournament, IIT Kharagpur had maintained its dominance over opponents. Their journey to the title included wins over IIT BHU (4-0), IIT Kanpur (3.5-0.5), IIT Bombay (2.5-1.5), IIT (ISM) Dhanbad (3.5-0.5), IIT Guwahati (3.0-1.0), draw with IIT Roorkee (2.0-2.0) and a solitary loss to IIT Madras (1.5-2.5). <br> An impressive record of 5 wins, 1 draw and 1 loss is certainly the fruits of the mental toughness and chess acumen of all the players. But what stands out for KGP in this journey is the outstanding performance of Kaustav Chakraborty, a first-year student, who wasn't only adjudged the second best player of the tournament but also was instrumental in KGP winning the crown with 5 wins and 2 draws in his 7 games. Though he lost to Tamhankar Viraj (IIT Roorkee) by just a mere difference of 0.5 points for the title of 'Best player of the tournament', showcasing such strong chess skills at such a big stage and making opponent players bite the dust effortlessly is no mean feat! And the contingent captain Hemanth Kumar Potluri infused the much-needed confidence into the team and marshalled the troop to the glory. Prithwi, Vivek, Saurabh and Gajendra too got into the act and had fun giving opponent players a taste of their own medicine.  <br> Their individual performances were as follow: <br> Koustav Chakraborty - 6 points (7 games) - 5 Wins, 2 Draws <br> Vivek Gupta - 5 points (7 games) - 4W, 2D, 1L <br> Hemanth Kumar Potluri - 4 points (7 games) - 3W, 2D, 2L <br> Prithwi Sinha - 2.5 points (4 games) - 2W, 1D, 1L <br> Saurabh Desai - 2.5 points (3 games) - 2W, 1D <br>  <br> This win marks a milestone as far as Chess Culture at IIT Is concerned. It will go a long way in infusing a new life to the interests of chess enthusiasts and work harder to retain the trophy next year. Not to forget, Chess club, IIT Kharagpur has also been quite active regarding the same and the credit for this thumping win goes to all the stakeholders including players, their mentors, officials etc. <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the entire Chess team for winning the trophy!", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-12T08:30:22+0000", "id": "156819310131_10155803061450132", "real_time": "02:00PM", "link": "http://chess-results.com/tnr318945.aspx?lan=1", "story": "The Scholars' Avenue shared IIT KGP Sports's post.", "real_date": "12-12-2017", "pic": null, "message": "<b>The Scholars' Avenue shared IIT KGP Sports's post.</b> <br>  <br> 3rd Inter IIT Chess Meet, IIT Madras: <br> IIT Kharagpur bags Gold! <br> Our team finished at the top of the table with 11 matchpoints at the end of seven intense rounds.

Nevertheless, there are students who could not get any job offer in the initial days and the CDC is apprehensive about the disappointment among such students.

So, the students need not lose their spirit and take part in the placement process to show their full potential.\" When asked about the growing disparity between the number of core sector companies and non-core companies coming for campus placements, he replied, \"We tried to call as many core sector companies as possible. But of course, there are several issues, many of them not responding for the first phase of placements. Many more PSUs are lined up after January and the students should not lose hope. Even in the first phase, many core sector companies have come.\" His message to the students is clear, \" Until you come to Nalanda, you can not get the job. So why lose hope? For an instance, 100 students registered for a company, but only 48 turned up in Nalanda for tests (Real Data). We expect more enthusiastic participation since not even half of the placement process is over yet. The companies would be shortlisting more number of students if more people appear for the tests and it increases the probability of more job offers.

Technology Robotix Society, IIT Kharagpur, in association with Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur conducted a two-hour seminar in Kolkata to acquaint students from different technical institutes within the city with the problem statements and events that are to be held this year at the grandest Techno-management fest this nation witnesses. Kshitij.  <br>  <br> The opening note of this seminar was an airy one, with our beloved Albatross hovering in mid-air over the audience, who enjoyed it a lot. Followed the series of bot demonstrations of the Problem statements for this year\u2019s events. Namely: Poles Apart, the manual event, Stax, the autonomous event and Fortress, the Image Processing event. <br>  <br> The objective of this workshop was to pull out to the limelight the fact that making a robot is not as difficult as people think it is. In fact, there are a lot of possible innovations that one can figure out and make the best out of it if given an opportunity like the robotics events at Kshitij. This was well pointed out by making a few classic and simple robots by the members of Technology Robotix Society. Like a gesture control bot, that is literally controlled by your fingertips. A stair-climbing robot demonstrating the importance of a mechanical design in making a useful bot, and finally a fully autonomous robot that can find it\u2019s way out of a corridor using only sonars.  <br>  <br> The workshop ended with the official release of the events that are to be held this year at Kshitij, along with the demonstration of a working prototype for each event. This was done to point out the fact that the events that we have set up for everyone to learn and have fun with are not only feasible but can prove to be a step in a direction that might take you to place, you never thought of. <br>  <br> Referring this workshop to a huge success will not be completely right, if not wrong because the real measure of success will be the participation and the enthusiasm which Kshitij will witness this year. Technology Robotics Society wishes that everyone fulfils our purpose of all the hard work that goes into making these events possible, that is, spreading the culture of robotics far and wide so that what we do can make a substantial impact on the society positively. <br>  <br> Hoping for a great participation and enthusiasm, we wish you good luck!", "source": "Technology Robotix Society", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-12-02T05:30:00+0000", "id": "121094537930788_1900000233373534", "real_time": "11:00AM", "link": "https://donorbox.org/iitkgp-student-health-and-wellness-program", "real_date": "02-12-2017", "pic": null, "message": "Amazing work by our alumni so far!

The recent state of affairs in our campus have been very unfortunate, hugely detrimental and in contradiction to an institute with a hallowed reputation. The root of most of the problems though can be traced back to skewed and misaligned perceptions of mental health, followed by some glaring inefficiencies in the systems put in place to keep a check on the same. Our institute's latest partnership with the anonymous online counselling forum, YourDOST, is an effort directed to remove the veil on the former.  <br> In this light, The Scholars' Avenue had a chance to interview one of the co-founders of this organisation - Ms.Richa Singh, also alumni of IIT Guwahati, one of our sister institutes.

A Gold Medal for a Bachelors in Physics at the Presidency University Madras was followed by a Master of Sciences with the highest distinction.  <br>  <br> Pursuit of the sciences brought him to academia in KOLKATA and thus began what he would fondly refer to as the golden era of his career. He continued his research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Sciences (IACS) of which he was also the Honorary secretary. It was IACS that Raman led experiments, along with K S Krishnan, on the scattering of light, and discovering what came to be known as the Raman effect. <br>  <br>  This discovery of immense importance soon garnered him recognition and fame and plaudits of the scientific community all over the world including enthusiastic mentions by the \u2018father of nuclear physics\u2019 Ernest Rutherford. He was soon conferred a knighthood and numerous awards. In receiving the Nobel Prize for #physics in 1930 he became the first Asian and non-european to receive the Nobel in the sciences.  <br>  <br> #CVRaman had and continues to spark the imagination of the scientific community of India till this day. He was born #OTD in 1888.

And they have come through in fine fashion. Their idea of a cycle pool got its wings when OLA took the initiative to make one in the campus. <br> The OLA cycle pool services (OLA Pedal) will see a trial period of a month or two first. Renting these cycles is also made hassle free as it would be similar to booking an OLA ride through the app. You enter a code, unique for each cycle, and the combination for the lock would be provided to you. And after you are done, you can drop it off to an OLA parking nearest to your destination, notify the app and the fares would be as per the following, for the trial period: free for the first 30 minutes (per ride), and then Rs.5 per 30 minutes. <br> The second phase would have much more sophisticated cycles, with a GPS, QR codes, smart locks, instead of the ones they have now, better security features to keep the cycles within the campus and much more. The campus will have around 400-600 of these cycles by the end of this week to be dispatched for public use with around 250 of them within the week.

All the current students can set up their accounts on the website (https://yourdost.com) and get all kind of assistance that they are looking for in their hard times. Accounts can be set up (for free) using only KGP LAN and WiFi. However, once registered, you can use the services anywhere and anytime. <br> On 31st October, the official launching ceremony was held at S.N. Bose auditorium. The event was attended by Mr. Puneet Manuja, Co-founder of YourDost, along with renowned psychologist Dr.Gini. But the participation from the student community was not so encouraging in number as there were hardly 40-50 students present there. Firstly, Mr. Puneet made the audience familiar with the online portal and services of YourDOST. He also added that this 24 x 7 active Counseling Center can be used free of cost only after you have registered through the institute network once. Later, the head psychologist of the YourDOST enlightened us about the basic terminologies and symptoms of mental health and illness. In the end of this interactive session, he earnestly suggested everyone to remove the stigma of visiting a psychologist for the help. <br> You can go through this PDF as well for some insights on mental health: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2WVb946Ykvzzsq1oeF_usHtOiTbXT63/view?usp=sharing", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-11-05T13:06:10+0000", "id": "1455755204715573_1820902048200885", "real_time": "06:36PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/director.iitkgp/photos/a.1455756128048814.1073741827.1455755204715573/1820902048200885/?type=3", "story": "Director IIT Kharagpur updated their cover photo.", "real_date": "05-11-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/23270508_1820902048200885_3389375880519939838_o.jpg?oh=fbc89a1acb69c996145b7202075ae78b&oe=5AA4D292", "source": "Director IIT Kharagpur"}, {"created_time": "2017-11-05T13:05:52+0000", "id": "149405445074499_1877211105627249", "real_time": "06:35PM", "link": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBLKN7P0ZJb14QnpoEipJZ4apfxJiIl41x1Q0hSzLpGLMOkQ/viewform", "real_date": "05-11-2017", "pic": null, "message": "TSG invites applications for turncoat(Debate) and Hindi storytelling event for 2nd Inter IIT cultural meet.

I have personally thanked our Director, IIT Kharagpur for being the part of the Open House session till the end and helping us resolve all the facts. <br>  <br> We had several meetings with different stakeholders to have an immediate action plan for our problems and prepared a thorough list of solutions. The attached action plan contains the suggestions of ours and the Director. I have tried to give few insights in each of the step giving you more clarity on the same. <br>  <br> ACTION ITEMS <br>  <br> The following points are references to the pdf attached. Kindly go through following points after going through pdf. <br>  <br> 1) As asked by few students in the Open House session, the Director has agreed for the external inquiry to be set up. He has himself talked to a retired judge of High Court for the same. However, on expressing concern from our side regarding the problems students involved in the event may face, the Director assured by saying that it will be tried to reduce the friction as much as possible. <br> 2) For the medical audit of BCRTH an expert committee will be appointed in 15 days, panel which would consist of about 2 male and 1 female doctor. We are expecting the audit to be done by the end of December. <br> 3) A complain portal with a complain escalation mechanism is being prepared. The basic feature of the complain portal will be prepared by us which would then be reviewed and improvised by the B C Roy Technology authorities. We are expecting the portal to be implemented by next week. <br> 4) Digitalization of B C Roy Hospital: We have proposed to make all the process of a normal visit of a student to BCRTH digitalized. This will include taking an appointment online, making a student's profile containing all the details of previous visits. Digitalization will remove all the ledger related work and will involve the least paper work. We are also trying to incorporate this in ERP helping students in a systematic approach towards the health issues. It will take about 3 months for the finalization. <br> 5) BCRTH has been stocked with certain life-saving items like anti-venom, anti-rabies etc and other items like clothes to be reviewed in one week. It has been done to equip the hospital 24*7 prepared to tackle few emergency issues. <br> 6) Regarding the public statement from the Institute, the Director has shared the Open House video from his personal Facebook page. <br> 7) We are taking a lot of initiatives by conducting several events for mental well being and also training G Sec Student Welfare Council, TSG and Student Welfare Group. For the same, an annual calendar list will be prepared and will be followed every year. <br> 8) A Dean's Council is being formed to assist Dean, SA and to tackle more student affairs. <br> 9) For a better fire emergency solutions, a plan is being developed by the security to have fire drill and checking the quality of extinguishers. <br> 10) One Annual Health Checkup (not mandatory) whose expenses will be integrated with medical insurances. <br> 11) Tie-ups with Railway hospitals are being made to handle more cases locally. <br> 12) A framework will be planned by December to develop a regulatory mechanism to assess the performance of BCRTH and Counselling Centre throughout the year. <br> 13) One Extra Academic Activity to be incorporated in already existing EAA system, National Cultural Organization. Technology Students' Gymkhana in association with SANDHI and Happiness Centre will be working on the same. <br>  <br> Status of ongoing action items have also been listed in the pdf. I urge you all to stay concerned about the progress of these points as they are of dire need, I will be more than happy to update you about any further development (ping me anytime). As I have stated in my earlier mail also that we, as a student community is also at fault somewhere as you can observe lack of interaction between seniors and even batch-mates, we need to revive our culture which is the core of our development and for the same I will communicate feasible action plan soon.

We also lay out our plan of action (point 6) to get our demands heard and met. <br>  <br> 1. Incident report <br> It was compiled to make student community aware of the account given by the eyewitnesses, and the responses (or the lack of it) by the administration on the same. We kept everything in the raw format so that the students could judge for themselves which claims are true, or what answers are satisfactory. We encourage everyone to raise any point from that report in the Open House in case they are unsatisfied.  <br>  <br> 2. Questionnaire distribution to admin and students <br> The objective of the Open House is to get clear cut answers out in the open to pressing questions and queries in the students\u2019 minds. This was the reason behind floating the questionnaire to the student community in advance. However, to prevent anyone from getting away from answering a difficult question by a simple \u2018we will look into it and get back to you\u2019, we think it is important that they receive a copy of the questions beforehand and come prepared to face the students. We will release the same copy to the students as well. <br>  <br> 3. Selection/Filtering of questions by Senate for Open House This was the most disheartening impression held by the students communicated to us. As the Senate, we are always on the students\u2019 side. We have been working hard to compile all questions collected by Awaaz\u2019s and the VP\u2019s survey. We want to finalize a repository of questions that cover different aspects of the issues at hand. We hope you can trust us enough to not tamper with the questions and let difficult ones be skipped by anyone. The major part of the session is for students to ask questions directly, a report of which will be compiled and again sent to everyone. <br>  <br> 4. Conversation with Mr Raghuvanshi, ASP <br> The purpose of visiting him and sharing the conversation was to bring out a missing perspective regarding the situation. We identified his to be a unique standpoint having closely seen both incidents people have been talking about. However, we were unable to frame our interaction to portray the same intention. By no means was that document a hidden threat against protests, a way to shift blame or even an attempt to absolve the status of B.C. Roy\u2019s facilities. We apologize for any anger or dissatisfaction caused due to our inability to recreate the conversation for you. No one can stop you to express yourself through peaceful protests. At the point when things start to escalate and lose control, the police will be bound to take actions. His statement was supposed to be a warning to students to keep things in check for their own benefit. A repeat of what happened back in 2009 can have some regretful consequences for some people, and we do not want that to happen to anyone unnecessarily.  <br>  <br> 5. Limiting the session to only B.C.R.H and Counseling Centre <br> To fulfil the objective of getting concrete solutions and directed answers, it is extremely necessary to keep asking questions that are on point. Diversifying the topic might lead to the focus being shifted, or people getting lost in the conversation. We will have other similar sessions in the future to tackle other issues. We hope you will show similar fervour towards them as well.  <br>  <br> 6. Action plan  <br> The student community is filled with anger and sorrow. It is important to channel these emotions productively. We plan to use this session to put up our demands. The administration is given an ultimatum to come up with the solutions, and the plan for implementation. If we feel, as a community, that their response is inadequate, we will protest (non-violently) against the administration for a better KGP on Saturday itself. We believe this to be the best course of action at the moment to get favourable results.", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-26T21:22:53+0000", "id": "156819310131_10155674357555132", "real_time": "02:52AM", "link": "https://medium.com/@thescholarsavenue/student-senates-message-to-the-students-c646174da0d7", "real_date": "27-10-2017", "pic": null, "message": "The Student Senate address some issues from the students through this post.

Roy Hospital Tales | Part 1 <br> Recently, we had released a feedback form on B.C. Roy Technology Hospital and most of the responses are an eye opener regarding the current state of affairs at one and only hospital available in the campus. We feel that it's equally important for all the people to get to know about some of these experiences* that people have had with this hospital. <br>  <br> Experience 1: <br> I had an accident on my cycle which cut off a decent chunk of my toe with the nail at 7am. I was made to sit waiting for over 30 mins with no first aid provided and hence, losing blood. And when someone finally came to clean up the wound, they were harsh and gave me a lecture having disturbed their sleep. <br> Another time, during the vacations, I had stitches in my ear which I requested to be checked and removed when ready. The removal was postponed by almost a week saying my wound hasn't healed which resulted in my wound getting septic due to inadequate cleaning. The stitch removal process in the septic state was extremely painful and when requested for a surface anaesthetic, I was told that it was a long procedure for allowance. So, I should \"MAN UP\". <br>  <br> Experience 2: <br> I was suffering from viral fever and the medicines prescribed by the initial examination couldn't cure me. As it worsened, I was hospitalised after 10 days. In the hospital, I was given high dosages of antibiotic (1000 mg) along with saline drip regularly. This was the first time I was given a drip (completely unnecessary). <br> After 2 days, my condition worsened with my temperature reaching up to 103 F. I contacted my family doctor who clearly told me that it was impossible to cure me with the medicines I was being given. My parents arrived the very next morning and I forcefully got myself discharged and taken to my hometown. I was there given no antibiotic, just some Vicks tablet and Dabur Honitus as the infection was in my throat which the BC Roy doctors couldn't find out. I became completely fine and came back to college in 5 days. <br>  <br> Experience 3: <br> I have a disease called migraine. Once, I reached B.C. Roy with a major attack of migraine and at the same time, they were handling a critical case of some other person. I was crying like anything. No one was ready to take my complaint while I literary cried in front of them. But no one was helping me, may be due to that critical case. I didn't want doctors to pay attention towards me instead of that critical case but I wanted them to have a sufficient number of emergency doctors to treat 12,000 KGPians. <br>  <br> Experience 4: <br> During my second year, I and my friend met with an accident. We went to the hospital late night and the doctor who was on the night shift in the emergency section said this to us - \"Yeh koi time hai aane ka\" **Is this a proper time to come to the hospital?** Later, after getting an X-ray, I got to know that I might be having a fracture on scaphoid bone. He wanted to confirm. So, he recommended 'another' X-ray and told me to come after a week because he won't be available. Finally, I settled with having a treatment outside our campus! <br>  <br> A one-liner response that conveyed various things at one go was \"Never been to BC Roy because of bad reviews\". <br>  <br> *All the concerned respondents have already been asked for their consent to publish their experiences here.", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-25T14:44:01+0000", "id": "136728150794_10155549772270795", "real_time": "08:14PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/AIESECglobal/photos/a.115873436819.110058.8496751819/10154919875411820/?type=3", "story": "AIESEC IIT Kharagpur shared AIESEC's post.", "real_date": "25-10-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22730044_10154919875411820_5808879577372357635_n.jpg?oh=88433cbc41b7257b569de74cfd829e21&oe=5AAA7C50", "message": "<b>AIESEC IIT Kharagpur shared AIESEC's post.</b> <br>  <br> Amazing things can happen when you love what you do.

As such, this post is about how B.C Roy Hospital\u2019s negligence and casual attitude has cost a life.  <br>  <br> Witnesses\u2019 account on what transpired in that ambulance - <br> Nikhil\u2019s serious condition got him referred to the nearest hospital capable of handling such cases - West Bank Hospital, Howrah. An ambulance left with two students with the patient along with an attendant and a special doctor, both of whom were said to be \u2018the best\u2019 B.C. Roy Hospital could provide. However, according to reports, their behavior towards the patient could only be accurately described as apathetic and cold. Nikhil\u2019s multiple injuries and the bumpy ride sometimes led to his limbs moving to awkward positions. On bringing the doctor\u2019s attention to this and asking if it would be appropriate to move it back to its original position, he glanced at the patient once and then looked away without giving any response. This was reportedly his attitude throughout the supercritical journey to Howrah, with two inexperienced boys having to take up the heavy responsibility of ensuring that Nikhil completes it alive. The ambulance was being guided by a police vehicle as the driver did not know the way to the hospital. He took a wrong turn into a one way road and in the attempt to get the vehicle back onto the main road, the ambulance broke down and everybody had to get down to push the vehicle to get it going, leaving Nikhil alone inside. It was during this ruckus that the IV drip to his arm (with the injections and the medicines) came out as well. While the doctor ignored this detail, the attendant tried to put the syringe back but then gave up saying \u2018it is only a matter of 10 minutes until we arrive at the hospital\u2019. It was at this point, the witnesses tell us, that Nikhil\u2019s health started declining rapidly and the urgency of the situation started escalating. The broken down ambulance was proving to be a dead end, and they hitched a lift on a truck to reach the hospital. What was just a matter of \u201810 minutes\u2019 became 45.

Menstruation marks the birth of fertility and this rangoli tries to show this phase of a woman\u2019s life. The upper region of rangoli depicts the universe and the celestial bodies. The moon cycle mirrors a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle, which lasts roughly 29.5 days, just as the waxing and waning of the moon. A woman\u2019s menstrual cycle changes from the menstruation of new growth to the ovulation of full power and blossom, to the pre-menstrual phase of harvest and degeneration, and back to menstruation of renewal again. Here you can see Venus, the Greek goddess of love, beauty, femininity, fertility and prosperity. The entire energy of the universe concentrates, forming a spiral, bestowing all its power to give women their inner strength. <br> The menstrual blood is sacred and self-nourishing, as you can see in the centre. These flames represent her core strength to fight her inner demons and also Indian celebrations or yagyas performed when a girl first menstruates. The lotus symbolizes the womb and water her ability to be calm and composed during tense situations. The greenery depicts her connection with Mother nature, the butterflies her freedom and flowers her beauty and elegance. <br> To the right is painted a picture of the harsh realities of today, because early religions never considered menstruation are unholy or impure. Whether ovulating or bleeding, struggling with pre-menstrual syndrome or conception, our bodies, energy levels, sense of self, even our abilities are constantly shifting each and every day. And yet, nobody talks about it \u2013 a taboo among more mundane and everyday topics. The myths, such as, a menstruating woman is dirty and impure, that she cannot worship, that when she touches a tree, it wilts and that can she cannot lead a normal life during that phase are baseless, for it\u2019s not the inner you but only the biology that is changing. Let us accept that menstrual blood is pure, sacred and respect women for being blessed with the power to give birth. <br> As Manu from Hindu Mythology says in Manusmriti, \u201cYatra Naryastu Pujyante, Ramanti Tatra Devtaha, Yatraitaastu Na Pujyante, Savastatra Afalaha Kriyaha\u201d <br> Which means \u2018the divine are extremely happy where women are respected, but where they are not, all actions, however good and holy, are fruitless\u2019. Let's talk about menstruation freely, not as if it's a taboo and let the flower of fertility blossom.", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-23T15:10:12+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1629084173778598", "real_time": "08:40PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1629083783778637/?type=3", "story": "Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur added 4 new photos.", "real_date": "23-10-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22712558_1629083783778637_7333621216504935149_o.jpg?oh=f17ed054480ca6b260b5b3979ec5fb83&oe=5A7CC016", "message": "Just a few days ago, IIT Kharagpur\u200b saw best of the Rangolis on the occasion of Diwali celebrations. Though each one of those was fabulous, some of them stood apart as per the judges. And many of you didn't get a chance to come through those due to various reasons like rain or staying at home.  <br> So, we present the Gold winning Rangoli of RP Hall. <br> Theme: Shiva Shakti Cha. <br> Description: As formerly presented, Daksha Prajapati disposed of the notion of inviting Shiva and Sati in his yaagya, but Sati been stubborn on her will to attend the yaagya, convinced Shiva to let his devotees escort her to the yaagya. Devi Sati\u2019s incoming wasn\u2019t welcomed at the yaagya, Daksh Prajapati spoke false in favour of her consort, insulted Lord Shiva which consequently angered Sati and she incarnated into \"Aadi Parshakti\" to curse Daksh Prajapati that he\u2019ll conceive death through Shiva\u2019s hands and she herself took samadhi at the very event. Later Shiva incarnated in form of Veerbhadra and realized the curse Daksha Prajapati was entitled to and killed him. Vishnu separated Aadi Parshakti\u2019s corpse into 52 pieces, to ensure her soul to rest in heaven. <br> Decades later after the happening of this event, Aadi Shakti again took birth on earth as Parvati and worshipped Lord Shiva to impress Shiva and marry her. <br> SHIVA symbolises consciousness, the masculine principle. SHAKTI symbolises the feminine principle, the activating power and energy. SHAKTI (or Prakriti) means energy, power, movement, change, nature. It is the maternal principle \u2013 the provider, abundance. SHIVA (or Purusha), on the other hand, is pure consciousness \u2013 the unchanging, unlimited and unswayable observer. Purusha has no desires whatsoever; these are inherent only in Prakriti. Purusha is the empty. <br> As described in Shiv Purana: <br> \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0930\u093e\u092a\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e \u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u0924\u094b: \u0938\u094d\u0925\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0964 <br> \u0928 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0928 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0928 \u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u092f\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e \u0936\u093f\u0935:\u0965 <br> Meaning, Shiva and Shakti always long for each other, neither can Shiva exist without Shakti, nor can Shakti exist without Shiva. <br> Only when Shiva and Shakti combine; action, movement and creation arise. Until energy is impregnated with consciousness; it is ignorant, disordered, aimless and \u201cblind\u201d. Energy alone can produce nothing; consciousness bestows upon it content, form and direction. Conversely, consciousness without energy is dormant power, sleeping energy, and on its own is unable to be the cause of anything. Just as Prakriti without Purusha is unable to act, and vice versa, Purusha without Prakriti is also incapable of creating anything. <br> Shakti is the motherly love of God that surrounds us with warmth, caring and protection. Shiva is the paternal love of God that gives us consciousness, clarity and knowledge. <br>   <br> Two different lights were used to depicts two different scenes in a single Rangoli. This Rangoli, under blue light, showed Shiva and under red light, showed Parvati. It was made up of 1 lakh 20 thousand pixels and included more than 360 shades of colours.", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-23T14:38:22+0000", "id": "1535609203342408_2064821283754528", "real_time": "08:08PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/kgpdag/photos/a.1535676160002379.1073741827.1535609203342408/2064821000421223/?type=3", "real_date": "23-10-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22688049_2064821000421223_8278032130144681597_n.jpg?oh=38d15cc5e5d467ff5ae29649a8cd590c&oe=5AAA95BE", "message": "Interested in Machine Learning and Data Analytics?  <br>  <br> Kharagpur Data Analytics Group(KDAG) is hiring UG 2nd, 3rd years & PG 1st years. <br>  <br> KDAG is a student driven research group solving industrial problem statements in machine learning. <br>  <br> Fill out the google form.

He was not a resident of LBS hall of residence. As soon as people found out, they called the ambulance. So, he was soon taken to the hospital in the ambulance. On seeing the student\u2019s condition, BC Roy Technology Hospital referred him to Kolkata.  The ambulance left the campus around 12:10 pm in the noon after completing all the paperwork where the student accompanying him was asked to get the signatures of the warden and a lot of other paperwork which almost took 40 minutes. In the meantime, there was a problem with the lights of the ambulance. So, another ambulance was called. Also, there was another delay of almost 10-15 minutes as the attendant was out of reach. During this time, as the pulse was near zero, the hospital people gave some injections and initial treatment to stabilize his pulse to 40-50. If they wouldn't have done it then he might have passed away right then. So it took nearly 25-30 minutes to stabilize the pulse. And finally, the ambulance left the campus around 12:10 pm.  The ambulance was accompanied by 2 escorts to Kolkata. Two of his friends with the Hall Manager, two attendants, and the doctor were in the ambulance. The driver misjudged a path to the hospital which further worsened the situation. As told by the accompanying students, the behavior of the hospital staff raised a lot of questions as they were not very supportive. The oxygen masks and the drips got mishandled and they were not able to fix it properly again. Prior to some 15-20 minutes before reaching the hospital, ambulance broke down and they were left in a miserable condition.  The students tried to get another vehicle. After a while and a lot of efforts of the students and the policeman accompanying them, a Tata Ace owner agreed to take them to the hospital. As soon as the additional SP and the Director got this news, they informed the hospital at the other end and an ambulance was started in a reverse way to attend the case, but as the ambulance came to the spot, they saw nobody and they got information that they have left using some other source. Midway, the tank of this vehicle got emptied. So, they got it refilled. After all this delay, they reached the hospital couple of minutes after 2:30 pm. And the doctors there, after some time, declared him dead.  <br>  <br> The reasons for the attempt of suicide, the role of administration, faculties, management, counseling center will be raised later after getting all the details. But, the main question that arises here is the ability of the BC Roy Hospital in one of the premier institutes of the country to handle 12,000 students and thousands of people residing in Kharagpur, when it does not even have basic amenities at its disposal and the behavior of the staff coming into question. Can't we have a fully functional hospital as it would serve more than 25000 people!  <br>  <br> We are not blaming anyone for the incident but some major steps need to be taken on priority in order to improve the medical facility standards at BC Roy Hospital as this is not the first time that such events have happened.

Nothing is permanent and neither are the adverse times. <br> If we stick around those who struggle to find flickers of hope, we might help them end up lighting a flame of their own.  <br> Life gives hope and probability of happiness in future, Death kills them all. <br> Hold on and let's help others in the same! <br> Here are some lines by Swami Vivekananda: <br>  <br> HOLD ON YET A WHILE, BRAVE-HEART <br> If the sun by the cloud is hidden a bit, <br> If the welkin shows but gloom, <br> Still hold on yet a while, brave heart, <br> The victory is sure to come. <br>  <br>  No winter was but summer came behind, <br> Each hollow crests the wave, <br> They push each other in light and shade; <br> Be steady then and brave. <br>  <br> The duties of life are sore indeed, <br> And its pleasures fleeting, vain, <br> The goal so shadowy seems and dim, <br> Yet plod on through the dark, brave heart, <br> With all thy might and main. <br>  <br> Not a work will be lost, no struggle vain, <br> Though hopes be blighted, powers gone; <br> Of thy loins shall come the heirs to all, <br> Then hold on yet a while, brave soul, <br> No good is ever undone.  <br>  <br> Though the good and the wise in life are few, <br> Yet theirs are the reins to lead, <br> The masses know but late the worth; <br> Heed none and gently guide. <br>  <br> With thee are those who see afar, <br> With thee is the Lord of might, <br> All blessings pour on thee, great soul, <br> To thee may all come right!", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-21T13:45:27+0000", "id": "741132932600291_1540701852643391", "real_time": "07:15PM", "link": null, "real_date": "21-10-2017", "pic": null, "message": "The results of Open IIT Quiz are as follows: <br>  <br> First Position: <br> Ashutosh Dwivedi <br> Mayank Roy <br> Amit Kumar Ram <br> Baibhab Pattnaik <br>  <br> Second Position: <br> Harsh Agarwal <br> Shubham <br> Abhimanyu Bharade <br> Saurav Chirania <br>  <br> Third Position: <br> Sudeshna Trilok <br> Mohit Tulsyan <br> Piyush Kedia <br> Prithwi Sinha <br>  <br> Technology Students' Gymkhana congratulates all the winners!", "source": "Technology IIT KGP", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-21T13:40:36+0000", "id": "149405445074499_1859990930682600", "real_time": "07:10PM", "link": null, "real_date": "21-10-2017", "pic": null, "message": "The results of Open IIT Quiz are as follows: <br>  <br> First Position: <br> Ashutosh Dwivedi <br> Mayank Roy <br> Amit Kumar Ram <br> Baibhab Pattnaik <br>  <br> Second Position: <br> Harsh Agarwal <br> Shubham <br> Abhimanyu Bharade <br> Saurav Chirania <br>  <br> Third Position: <br> Sudeshna Trilok <br> Mohit Tulsyan <br> Piyush Kedia <br> Prithwi Sinha <br>  <br> Technology Students' Gymkhana congratulates all the winners!", "source": "Technology Students Gymkhana", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-21T07:24:13+0000", "id": "129788793265_10156779726123266", "real_time": "12:54PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/ecell.iitkgp/photos/a.137744623265.142018.129788793265/10156779721193266/?type=3", "real_date": "21-10-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22538955_10156779721193266_4526192596095032898_o.jpg?oh=8e78ff6b58cfb58565467b7db868b7fd&oe=5A7E0273", "message": "\"Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do, so throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbor, Explore, Dream, Discover.\"  - Mark Twain <br> Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur brings to you the first series of campaigns.Answer the following question, using clues given in the question itself!  <br> Submit your answers at https://tinyurl.com/yb4ct9zs and get an opportunity to directly enter the final round of our freshers selections. <br> Register now for the selections - ecell-iitkgp.org/selections.php <br> #Freshers_Selections_2k17 <br> #Coming_Soon", "source": "Entrepreneurship Cell", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-21T07:02:30+0000", "id": "146188872068143_1626966640657018", "real_time": "12:32PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/awaaziitkgp/photos/a.146211918732505.22874.146188872068143/1626966640657018/?type=3", "real_date": "21-10-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/22539874_1626966640657018_2854989857871066819_n.jpg?oh=eac4ca0d458f6f8447cf40aa6b005f98&oe=5A7A0C17", "message": "Bewildered with the bunch of options and stuff to do in order to fetch a good internship or job?

The institute has done many research works, published them and obtained the patent for the same, and now it's time to implement those efforts for the benefits of the society, as stated by Prof. Siddartha Mukhopadhyay, Dean of Alumni Affairs and International Relations, IIT Kharagpur. The institute is looking forward to collaborating with industries from Germany and France working in India for their CSR initiatives. Corporate groups and NGOs are already excited about the potential when a technology giant collaborates with an NGO for the welfare of society. The Shrachi group has already shown interest to tie-up with IIT Kharagpur for its WASH (Water, Sanitation, Hygiene) project. More than 50% of the projects are presently active or ready to be operational in the institute which is aligned with the CSR strategies of different companies, an IIT Kharagpur spokesperson said. <br> To take forward this idea, Rajiv Gandhi School of Intellectual Property Law, IIT Kharagpur is taking a remarkable step by organising a short-term course on Corporate Governance towards Corporate Social Responsibility. This course is open to all faculties from Universities or the institute or interested people from the industry and other organizations.

For the freshers who will be going to witness this trademark celebration of Diwali for the first time, they must be feeling intrigued when they find the air buzzing with \u2018illu\u2019.

The Guest of Honour, Professor Somesh Kumar, Dean (SA) and the Convener, Mr Anirudha Saha (Judge, Jhargram) inaugurated the programme by lightening the lamp. Professor Somesh Kumar introduced the need of Sahaja Yoga Meditation especially for the students to achieve the true excellence in their lives. <br>  <br> \u201cWe talk about \u2018Atmavishwas\u2019- the self-confidence and \u2018Atmasamman\u2019- the self-respect but do we ever think about \u2018Atma\u2019 itself?\u201d, with these words, Mr Anirudha Saha underlined the human\u2019s association with the pervading energy in the universe and advocated the regular practice of Sahaja Yoga for the Human Resource Development as well as Management. <br> Mr Anurag Kushwaha who presently works at DRDO, New Delhi and has been practising Sahaja Yoga Meditation for 15 years, delivered a presentation discussing on how we can achieve the thoughtless awareness through \u2018Sahaja Yoga\u2019 leading towards the eternal happiness. He also discussed the science of this method which serves to get back the control over the dormant energy (Kundalini) that resides within ourselves. <br>  <br> The workshop also comprised of cultural performances conveying the art as an indispensable part of Yoga. Mr. Deepak Sharma, a Kathak dancer from the prestigious Lucknow Gharana and his daughter Aarshi Sharma presented stellar dance performances followed by a Rajasthani folk dance staged by Sarita Srivastava. Mr. Deepak Verma, a renowned singer, chanted Bhajans with Mr. Pradyut Kumar Pal playing the Tabla and both creating a delightful environment in the amphitheatre. <br>  <br> Sahaja Yoga Organisation is to arrange for another workshop on Sahaja Yoga Meditation at TOAT, on Sunday at 5pm. Besides, similar sessions for meditation are to be held at Technology Staff Club every Sunday at 10am. We urge the student community to actively take part in such workshops so that the efforts of the institution get repaid in the form of healthy lives of its students.   <br> Those who are interested in Sahaja Yoga Meditation can find more information about the same, here:  <a href=\"http://www.sahajayoga.org\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.sahajayoga.org... </a> /", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-10-08T05:00:00+0000", "id": "180439175309899_1623454457675023", "real_time": "10:30AM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/communique.iitkgp/photos/a.459489200738227.102627.180439175309899/1623454027675066/?type=3", "real_date": "08-10-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/22254834_1623454027675066_946210254407078731_o.jpg?oh=38a426c769a2a2d2ca96667fea70f554&oe=5A8242C5", "message": "Communiqu\u00e9 in association with T.I.M.E.

All the students are requested to devote some time, suggest even the minute details and help the administration make the revamp a successful one. The fact that such revamp is happening after almost a decade and there are minimal chances that a big revamp would occur in near future after this, so everyone should make the best use of the opportunity and help IIT Kharagpur and upcoming generation of students reap the benefits of your experiences and ideas. <br>  It is advisable to go through the academic curriculum of some of the elite universities and suggest accordingly.

The next round is scheduled for September 24th. <br>  <br> 1) Prepare with a codelab (duration ~2-3 hours) <br> We've prepared a small codelab (a tutorial combining explanation, working example code, and code exercise) to cover some basic algorithms which will help in the upcoming Code Jam Kickstart (CJK) rounds. Even if you do not plan to participate in the upcoming rounds, the codelab should help brush up basics for other algorithmic contests and interviews.  <br>  <br> For the codelab, you would need an internet connection and basic programming skills in a language of your choice, and of course, a little enthusiasm and energy to get through the codelab. We recommend having facilitators (a faculty or a fellow student) who can help if needed, and pursue the codelab as a group exercise. If you're a facilitator, it would be nice to brush up some combinatorics, dynamic programming (DP) and geometry skills. The time it would take a student to finish the codelab would depend on their current understanding and skill, but to err on the safe side, be ready to put in 2-3 hours. <br>  <br> 2) Sign-up for the Codelab by 20th Sep <br> Please sign-up via this form (  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXuYa3JLlJPSd7xkyVpflIwiqwjsg9TPo9WSCenthdDEG6nQ/viewform\" target=\"_blank\"> https://docs.google.com/f... </a>  ) and we will send you the codelab material via email. We recommend that you work on the codelab in groups so that it's both fun and you can learn from one another. And plan on having a facilitator (a faculty or a fellow student) who can help if needed. <br>  <br> Feedback/Questions <br> When we send the codelab via email, we will also send a link to a feedback form. Any concepts that are difficult or if you have questions about specific problems, please share/ask via the feedback form. We will address them as part of a livestream that we are hosting in the first week of October. <br>  <br> Post September 24th <br> We will host a Youtube livestream, in which we'll cover questions/concepts asked in the codelab exercise, discuss problems from a previous CJK round, common tips and tricks, strategies and general Q&A regarding CJK.

The stadium experienced decent turnout of the crowd cheering for their Halls of Residence. Yesterday, it all started with Junior Men & Women events in 800 meters. SN Hall of Residence performed exceptionally well by bagging a total of 3 medals in Junior Women category. MS Hall, the defending champions of GC Athletics Men, left everyone speechless by securing a total of 5 medals, all the three in the senior category and gold & silver in the junior category. Manish Singh Rana (MMM Hall) managed to win the gold for his hall of residence in both 800 m and 1500 m. Lokesh Reddi and Gaurav Shenoy were among the few names who secured medals in every event they participated and left no stone unturned to contribute towards the sport. Among girls, Bharti Kushal Sharma, Dimple Kapadia, and Hima Swetha showed outstanding performances. In Men JR category, Sagar Kongari, Eslavatha Jaga Deesh, and Sumit Gaurav have shown exceptional performances by winning more than one medal for their respective halls. <br>  <br> MS Hall continues its legacy in GC Athletics by scoring a sum of 53 points on Day 1 and Day 2. According to the current tally of points, the competition for the second position is too fierce with the difference of just one point between RP (14 Points) and LBS (13 Points). In GC Athletics women\u2019s category, SN Hall of Residence is leading others with 30 points. Junior events, however, with the contribution of no points in General Championship, were also quite successful with the active participation in Men\u2019s category. <br>  <br> With the showcase of such fine performances, we expect the events will exhibit the same enthusiasm and sportsmanship and Day 3 will witness wonders.

As no Indian Institute could make it into top 200, it certainly proved that things were not going right and there were points to ponder over! <br> In its note, the finance ministry also recommended that the human resource development ministry should ask IITs to construct world-class laboratories through existing grants or the recently launched Institute of Eminence scheme.

Needless to say, this has been an epic experience for many. <br>  <br> He visited Nehru Hall of Residence and interacted with students. A lot of funny moments and light conversations followed. Students were visibly excited and pleased to the core. Zakir didn't let the moment slip and tried his hands on bat-ball making it a \"moment-hai-bhai-moment-hai\" moment! There were plans to visit LLR hall as well but unfortunately, he wasn't able to. <br> Though he was here for a short period of time, he left behind smiles on hundreds of faces and that's what was the motive behind this initiative.

Our institute has always been the unprecedented one - even during birth and even now. But a slight tumor has started to grow, something we have recognised as a universal sin plaguing the entirety of this generation and now it's caught us in its whimsical hands. Over the past few months, our campus had the most misfortune to witness the demise of a fraction of our student community, tiny in number but gigantic in worth. It's no easy feat to recuperate from such mental fractures, but all it takes is just a little push, in the right direction, to build bridges to paradise. This is exactly what we've set in motion, if we as eyes of the campus, read right today's move. <br>  <br> In a secretive partnership, our VP - Mayank Srivastava along with TSG had talks with Zakir Khan, the rising face of comedy in the country, and asked him to pay a surprise visit to KGP, and Zakir accepted with much humility.

Our institute has always been the unprecedented one - even during birth and even now. But a slight tumor has started to grow, something we have recognised as a universal sin plaguing the entirety of this generation and now it's caught us in its whimsical hands. Over the past few months, our campus had the most misfortune to witness the demise of a fraction of our student community, tiny in number but gigantic in worth. It's no easy feat to recuperate from such mental fractures, but all it takes is just a little push, in the right direction, to build bridges to paradise. This is exactly what we've set in motion, if we as eyes of the campus, read right today's move. <br>  <br> In a secretive partnership, our VP - Mayank Srivastava along with TSG had talks with Zakir Khan, the rising face of comedy in the country, and asked him to pay a surprise visit to KGP, and Zakir accepted with much humility.

We are hopeful to start it from the next session,\u201d <br> Presently researcher-students get Rs 25,000 as monthly scholarship at IITs. <br>  <br> We believe that this will financially empower students having a keen interest in research to continue their work without being forced to opt for lucrative corporate jobs for higher pay. <br>  <br> Source:  <a href=\"http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-central-fellowship-of-rs-70000-for-iit-phd-researchers-2535151\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.dnaindia.com/i... </a> ", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-08-20T05:30:58+0000", "id": "1455755204715573_1792212174403206", "real_time": "11:00AM", "link": "http://www.ndtv.com/education/iit-kharagpur-tata-medical-center-to-launch-inter-disciplinary-research-1739447", "real_date": "20-08-2017", "pic": null, "message": " <a href=\"http://www.ndtv.com/education/iit-kharagpur-tata-medical-center-to-launch-inter-disciplinary-research-1739447\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.ndtv.com/educa... </a> ", "source": "Director IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-08-20T04:27:37+0000", "id": "264571336911852_1407032149332426", "real_time": "09:57AM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/SWGIITKGP/photos/a.280380848664234.57993.264571336911852/1407031772665797/?type=3", "story": "Student Welfare Group (SWG)  IIT Kharagpur added 6 new photos \u2014 with Vivek Gupta and 3 others.", "real_date": "20-08-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/20863677_1407031772665797_8686360428729125520_o.jpg?oh=b8d997a93efe4180baf363cd2b437edb&oe=5A2BAA85", "message": "Some glimpses from yesterdays Mentor-Mentee Meeting.

This year RoboCup was held in Nagoya, Japan. They participated in two leagues in RoboCup - Small Sized League and Humanoid Simulation League. <br> This year, it was their first participation in the Small Sized League and they faced a lot of technical difficulties. A total of twenty-four teams had qualified for the league, out of which only twenty could finally make it to the league. The twenty teams were divided into four groups. From each group, first two teams on the basis of performance were selected for the quarter finals. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t make it to the quarters.  <br> In the humanoid simulation league, it was their second participation. They stood 8th among 13 teams. They were able to defeat 5 different teams in one to one matches. They won a total of 7 matches, drew 3 and were in the quarter finals. They missed the chance to go to the semi finals by just one match! <br> Next year, the RoboCup will be held in Montreal, Canada.

Every society puts up a great effort just to capture a part of that board space, to ultimately capture your eye and even more to sell themselves to you later on. Before any narcissism creeps in, we would like to point out the importance of the existence of this plethora of opportunities out there. For starters, the sheer number of these societies is what differentiates KGP from the rest of the IITs.

It can be installed at any place where cleanliness needs to be monitored at regular intervals. At present, these public facilities are generally cleaned at fixed intervals, irrespective of how dirty they are. <br> The device has been developed using an embedded platform incorporated with sensors that are connected via the Internet of Things (IoT). \u201cThis monitor using sensors detects the level of hygiene in a room and through cloud sends data to the stakeholders,\u201d Prof. Routray said, adding that the setup cost for a 20-sq ft area would be less than Rs 5,000. <br>  <br> Source:  <a href=\"http://m.economictimes.com/news/science/iit-kharagpur-develops-low-cost-cleaning-technology/amp_articleshow/59852497.cms\" target=\"_blank\"> http://m.economictimes.co... </a>  <br>  <br> Awaaz, IIT Kharagpur congratulates the entire team for their accomplishment!", "source": "Awaaz IIT Kharagpur", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-08-01T08:57:36+0000", "id": "273738259309676_1845959302087556", "real_time": "02:27PM", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/tlsiitkgp/photos/a.273745919308910.84567.273738259309676/1845958795420940/?type=3", "real_date": "01-08-2017", "pic": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/20431468_1845958795420940_7112102139388465182_n.jpg?oh=706186e7557567983d7512269a87a51a&oe=5A5A5087", "message": "Rate?

Same goes for IIT Patna with Rs. 8.36 crores. <br>  <br> 3) Avoidable expenditure towards penal charges on electricity consumption: IIT Madras had incurred an avoidable expenditure of Rs. 1.05 crores towards penalty for exceeding contracted demand during April 2013 to March 2016 due to non-review and enhancement of sanctioned demand. <br>  <br> 4) Irregular waiver of overpayment: The Board of Governors of IIT Jodhpur irregularly waived recovery of excess payment amounting to Rs. 59.38 lakhs made to its faculty, which is now under recovery at the instance of Audit. <br>  <br> 5) Irregular reimbursement of LTC (Leave Travel Concession) claims by Central Autonomous Bodies: Central Autonomous Bodies irregularly reimbursed air fares of Rs. 6.90 crores during 2012-16 against the air tickets purchased by their employees from unauthorised agents in violation of the MoF guidelines for availing Leave Travel Concession. IIT Kharagpur, despite delayed submission of claims, did not recover LTC advance of Rs. 1.14 crore of which Rs. 19.85 lakh was to be forfeited.

But when will we get there, and how will we get there? <br>   <br> Two terms for the transition have become standard in the auto industry. There's the \"evolutionary\" path to autonomous vehicles, where today's cars get self-driving features bit by bit \u2014 Tesla's autopilot feature, for example. And then there's the \"revolutionary\" path. That's where totally self-driving cars, like the ones Google is working on, start as test vehicles and become more mainstream as they can drive in more places. <br> There's an ongoing debate over which path is the safer one. But these paths will eventually converge. <br>   <br> Today's most advanced semi-autonomous features can be found in Tesla's and a few other cars that allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel on a highway. Using a series of sensors and cameras, cars can also merge, self-park, stay within a lane and brake as needed. <br>   <br> This tech works particularly well for commercial trucks that operate on highways. Companies like Peloton and NXP are \"platooning\" trucks \u2014 tying them together through a vehicle-to-vehicle communication system. A \"pilot\" truck drives while those behind can sit and relax. <br>  <br> Google and Ford are testing self-driving cars in structured environments like test tracks, as well as cities with relatively light traffic, like Austin, Texas and Mountain View, Calif. Vehicles travel at slow speeds \u2014 up to 25 miles an hour \u2014 while gathering data on pedestrians and human drivers; they are also starting to drive at night, and in rain and snow. <br>   <br> By 2019, Driver-assistance features will get more sophisticated, and will sync up with GPS and navigation. So a driver should be able to input a destination while driving on a highway, turn on adaptive cruise control and let the car drive itself. When it gets to the appropriate exit, the car will return control to the driver. <br>  <br> In the USA, NHTSA (NATIONAL HIGHWAYS TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION) has begun working on rules for testing and deployment of fully autonomous vehicles, without a driver, across the country. In the meantime, companies like Google will be racking up miles to gather data about every single type of situation a self-driving vehicle might encounter; mapping companies will gather as much 3D data in major cities as possible. Car makers and tech companies will have to make sure light detection and ranging (lidar) and radar sensors, as well as cameras and GPS, can work together, while ensuring that each component can function independently if one of them fails <br> . <br> Companies will also be testing vehicles in all climates and environments, including rain and snow. They'll also test cars in more places, moving from test tracks and low-density cities to roads with more foot and vehicle traffic.  <br>   <br> Commercial trucks will likely be the first vehicles to hit the road autonomously, if state and federal regulators give them them the go-ahead to work on highways.  <br>   <br> Here is one such article on the legislation making rounds in the Congress for federal rules on self driving cars to supersede state and local regulations : <br>   <br>  <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/congress-autonomous-self-driving-car-regulations/\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.wired.com/sto... </a> ", "source": "Autonomous Ground Vehicle", "flag": 1}, {"created_time": "2017-07-02T08:39:19+0000", "id": "1433721693547904_1858387001081369", "real_time": "02:09PM", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhGewF4Xyo0&feature=youtu.be", "story": "Metakgp shared Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS's post.", "real_date": "02-07-2017", "pic": null, "message": "<b>Metakgp shared Kharagpur Open Source Society - KOSS's post.</b> <br>  <br> Whenever Apple releases a new version of the IPhone, a vast majority of users will flock to buy the current version, although previous versions are still well in use.
