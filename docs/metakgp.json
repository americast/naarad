Help us make this information widely available for your fellow students.\n\nGreetings KGP!\nNational Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) recently published their yearly rankings for 2017 of educational institutions in India, in which IIT Kharagpur was placed 4th in the overall rankings.\n\nOne of the parameters used by NIRF for ranking is 'Facilities for Physically Challenged Students' which asks the following questions:\n1. Does your institution have Lifts/Ramps?\n2. Does your institution have provision for walking aids, including wheelchairs and transportation from one building to another for handicapped students?\n3. Does your institution have specially designed toilets for handicapped students?\n\nWe believe this information isn't immediately accessible to the students as well as the administration currently and would like your help gathering it. Please take a minute and help us by editing the relevant Wiki page here:\nhttps://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Facilities_for_Physically_Challenged_Students", "id": "1433721693547904_1928720607381341"}, {"created_time": "2017-11-15T12:09:17+0000", "pic": null, "link": "https://goo.gl/forms/HmuVknW1DqFAA8EG2", "message": "Hey KGP!\nThe time for downloading our endsem admit cards is here.
